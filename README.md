When the camera is removed from the rest of the children of the cat the camera is now stuck in a singular spot while the player can still move the cat around.

### W2
1. The r, g, and b variables are floats because they represent a color value that isn't defined by integers alone, but by fractions. So we must identify them as floats instead of integers.

2. The _bounce variable is an integer because a "bounce" cannot be done in fractions like a float. Instead we use integer because it uses solely whole numbers for descrbing how many bounces the ball has done.

3. The error message I received said "colon expected" which helped me figure out that I needed to add a colon to make the line of code a statement and be able to run in unity.

### W3
1. Our table is number #3 and we concluded that the return type would be a bool type and that would mean the parameters are setup as false, and so if the player misses the beat it stays false until the player does hit the beat, then it will become true.

2. Components are like concerts, making classes the perfomance itself while member variables are the specific artists playing in the perfomacne which leaves the methods as the instruments being used to make the music for the performance.
