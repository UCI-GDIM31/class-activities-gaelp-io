When the camera is removed from the rest of the children of the cat the camera is now stuck in a singular spot while the player can still move the cat around.

### W2
1. The r, g, and b variables are floats because they represent a color value that isn't defined by integers alone, but by fractions. So we must identify them as floats instead of integers.

2. The _bounce variable is an integer because a "bounce" cannot be done in fractions like a float. Instead we use integer because it uses solely whole numbers for descrbing how many bounces the ball has done.

3. The error message I received said "colon expected" which helped me figure out that I needed to add a colon to make the line of code a statement and be able to run in unity.
